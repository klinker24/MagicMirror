MagicMirror
===========

The super magic interface of my personal Magic Mirror. More information about this project can be found on my [blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror).

Runs as a php script on a web server with basically no external dependencies. Can use socket.io for XBEE integration, but isn't required for basic functionality.

You can spin up a localhost server to run off of with:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```
